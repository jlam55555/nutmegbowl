  Nutmeg Bowl is a fun place to spend time bowling. The staff is very friendly and the rates are reasonable. The Backyard Playhouse is great for little ones, too.

  Like the bowling experience (Cosmic Bowling) &hellip; The music selection was good, uptempo and clean. The price was good at $18 for 1 hour and 1/2 which included the shoes. A must try.
